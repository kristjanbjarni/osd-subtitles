# OSD Subtitles

![Screenshot](docs/osd-subtitles.jpg)

This utility combines OpenTX telemetry log files with [Betaflight] OSD elements and produces a subtitle file with OSD overlay similiar to the the Betaflight OSD. You can then play your flight video with subtitle OSD elements in a video player like [VLC] or import them into Youtube or some other web player. Not all OSD elements are currently supported and some may display differently from Betaflight.

## Click on [osd-subtitles] to start using the utility.
