# OSD Subtitles

This utility combines OpenTX telemetry log files with [Betaflight] OSD elements and produces a subtitle file with OSD overlay similiar to the the Betaflight OSD. You can then play your flight video with subtitle OSD elements in a video player like [VLC] or import them into Youtube or some other web player. Not all OSD elements are currently supported and some may display differently from Betaflight.
